Data, statistical analyses, and R scripts accompanying Maire et al. Micronutrient supply from global marine fisheries under climate change and overfishing, 2021, Current Biology.

Using the [SAU catch reconstruction database](http://www.seaaroundus.org/tools-guide/), we extracted catches from the EEZ of each country in tonnes and by species for the period 2010â€“2014. 
We considered reported and unreported catches from the EEZ of each country and we excluded discards from these data. We limited the scope of our study to marine fisheries. 

[data](/data) contains .csv and .RData files of data underlying Figs 1-4 and S1-S5.

[r](/r) contains .R scripts with code to create Figs 1-4 and S1-S5. 

[figures](/figures) contains outputs (Figs 1-4 and S1-S5).

Data viz and analyses were run in R 4.0.3.

If you would like to replicate the analysis, clone this repository and run the R code.
